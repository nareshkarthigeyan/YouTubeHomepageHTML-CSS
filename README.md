# YouTubeHomepageHTML-CSS

- First HTML/CSS project
- Coded with HTML/CSS to closely recreate the light mode version of Youtube web
- Used the same 4 to 5 sample videos 
- Played around with flex/flexboxes and divs and grid
- (FINALLY CAN CENTER A FLEX)
- TRY: resizing the page when you're in the site.
